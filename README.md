system_config_files
===================

Miscellaneous configuration files

[Most] dotfiles setup by running
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aloyr/system_config_files/master/setup.bash | sudo bash`

You *will need* a file named _config_ on your current folder. You can create one with the following command:
`echo "yourname@gmail.com" > config`
