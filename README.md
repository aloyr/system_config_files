system_config_files
===================

Miscellaneous configuration files for Macs, but should work on \*nix too.

Setup [most] dotfiles by running

`
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aloyr/system_config_files/master/setup.bash | sudo bash
`

You **will need** a file named **config** on your current folder. You can create one with the following command:

`
echo 'GITEMAIL="yourname@gmail.com"' > config
`
